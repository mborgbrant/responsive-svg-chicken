# responsive-svg-chicken

A simple demo on how to animate scalable vector graphics only by the use of CSS animations embedded in a SVG file.
See the full demo [here](http://mborgbrant.github.io/responsive-svg-chicken/)

Tested in Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Works perfectly in Chrome and Safari, but not that smooth in Firefox.

Fork me. Together we can build a zoo.
